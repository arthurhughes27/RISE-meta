## Quick start

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure the required project structure:
```r
source("analysis/create_project_structure.R")
```
3. Download the raw data (described below) and place it in `data-raw/`.
4. Install dependencies and recreate software environment
```r
renv::restore()
```
5. Run the full analysis pipeline:
```r
source("analysis/analysis_master.R")
```
Note that due to extensive simulations, this may take a long time (see Runtime information section below). 

---

## Reproducing the software environment

This repository uses [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) for package management. To restore the exact package versions used in this analysis:

```r
renv::restore()
```

The complete package environment is recorded in `renv.lock`.

## Analysis

### Full pipeline

```r
source("analysis/analysis_master.R")
```

Runs:

- package installation and software environment reproduction
- project folder structure
- preprocessing
- descriptive analysis
- real-data application
- simulation study 

*NOTE: * due to the extensive number of simulations performed, running the simulation files may take several hours or even days.
See the *Runtime information* section below for details and suggestions. 

---

### Preprocessing

```r
source("analysis/preprocessing/preprocessing_master.R")
```

Steps:

- clinical data preprocessing
- gene expression preprocessing
- immune response preprocessing
- gene set preprocessing
- dataset merging

Outputs of preprocessing go in `data/`

---

### Descriptive analysis

Runs descriptive analyses of the data and produces two supplementary figures.

```r
source("analysis/descriptive/descriptive_master.R")
```

Outputs:

- visual description of dataset (Web Figure 1)
- data for flowchart of samples after each preprocessing step (Web Figure 2)

Saved in:

- `output/results/descriptive/`
- `output/figures/descriptive/`

---

### Application

Runs main and supplementary analyses on real data. 

```r
source("analysis/application/application_master.R")
```
Outputs: 

- Low-dimensional data application (Figure 3)
- High-dimensional data application (Figures 3, 4)
- Supplementary analyses (Supplementary Web Figures 9-13)

Saved in:

- `output/figures/application/`

---

### Simulation

Runs scripts to produce simulation results. 

```r
source("analysis/simulation/simulation_master.R")
```

Outputs: 

- Main simulation results (Figures 1, 2) 
- Supplementary simulation results (Web Figures 4-8)

Saved in:

- `output/results/simulation/` (raw results data)
- `output/figures/simulation/` (figures)

--- 

## Runtime information

The full analysis pipeline takes roughly 1 day on a standard laptop, e.g. one with specs similar to:

- Dell Inc. Precision 5470 
- 12th Gen Intel® Core™ i7-12700H processor × 20 cores
- 16GB RAM

However, the grand majority of this computational time is taken by the simulation study. 
When excluding the simulation study from the `analysis_master.R` script, the runtime reduces to around 5 minutes. 

To reduce this computational time, one may reduce the number of repetitions in the simulation studies. 
In the simulation files, these are controlled by the variable `J`, which is set to 100,000. To reduce this, you
may replace this with a smaller number. 
In RStudio, on default key bindings this can be achieved by 

- pressing `Ctrl+Shift+F` (find in files)
- typing exactly `J = 100000` and clicking "find"
- clicking "Replace" in the "Find in Files" window
- typing e.g. `J = 10000` and clicking "Replace All"
- Running the master script

---

## Parallelisation

Parallel computing has been used to render some parts of the analysis quicker. 
By default, we detect the number of cores on the user's hardware using `parallel::detectCores()` use half of the available cores. 
To increase or decrease this (e.g. if your RStudio crashes when trying to run the analysis), simply replace the line 
`n.cores = parallel::detectCores(all.tests = FALSE, logical = TRUE)/2` with e.g. `n.cores = 1` using the Find in Files approach described above.
